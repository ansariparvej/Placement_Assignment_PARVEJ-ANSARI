"@Krish Naik - Hi Krish, I listen to your courses seriously and absorb them as much as I can. My genuine respect for you.  Requesting Krish, to create playlists on FAST API - ML  if possible and full playlists for other areas like you did it for ML and deep learning playlists."
"Hello Krish , How are you ? 

 I am new in ML , but also I am in my mid-career level.. having 15+ years of IT experience.. I have been working in D, ETL areas, but need to switch to ML. Can you please suggest me what are the key things I can learn at this stage and if you could suggest me any suitable learning path ( like any Youtube video link/ course link) to start with, will be really helpful. Thank you !!"
"@krish Naik - Hi Krish, I am told by my friend to watch your vids for good understanding of Data Science role. I’m from a finance sector and want to switch to data science. So this video kind of helps me to go through your playlists accordingly. I have one important question, i.e. I also want to enroll to Data science courses where a certification has its value as I’m from finance sector so a validated certification would help me. So which is the best one to enroll in regards to materials/concepts for this year and also placement support. Thanks. Hoping for a reply."
"Always a pleasure listening to you 


Great work"
sir i wanted to ask if we should prefer watching 7 days live videos or the particular playlist
A) How does this course help for an existing student of ineuron in DS?  B)What will be the extra curriculum added.  C)  will the project part is LIVE?
"Just a question, when should I go for the live lectures and when to the offline uploaded ones(those which are 100+ videos playlist).

Thanks in Advance"
Heyy krish i have a question for you can i develop a career with a mixture of data science + devOps?
"Hi Krish, can we have a Machine Learning Engineer Roadmap in the same manner? Thanks."
"Hey Krish, can you please make a video on revised best online courses (which provides good material as well as a valuable certification) ?? There's a video but, it's from 3 years back. Thank you in advance."
@krish Naik - How important is it for someone transitioning into data science to have a certification or it is ok if you self-study this skillset
"Sir, please explain the difference between the iNeuron ""Full stack data science 2.0"" course and the PWskills ""Data science masters"" course offered by you, which one to buy???"
All content of pwskills should be same as INeuron .... It means it is a way to explore business... I will prefer ineuron course... If possible kindly increase discount from 50%
thankyou krish you r amazing in providing roadmaps
Hats off to you sir
