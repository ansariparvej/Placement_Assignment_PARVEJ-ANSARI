Abstract : The av ailability of multiple services such as online 
banking , entertainment, educatio n, software downloading,  
and social networki ng has accelerated the Web's evolution in 
recent years. As a result, a massive amount of data is 
constantly downloaded and transferre d to the Internet. This 
allows attackers to access sen sitive personal or financ ial data 
such as usernam es, passwords, accou nt numbers, and social 
security numbers. This is known as a Web phishing attack, and 
it is one of the most serious issues in web secu rity. Web 
phishing attempts have become much more comm on in recent 
years, and p hishing is now considere d one of the most 
hazardous Web crimes, with potentially disastrous 
consequences for online businesses.  The phisher constructs a 
fake or phishing website  to deceive Web users and get their 
sensitive financia l and personal informatio n in a Web 
phishing attac k. Phishing attacks  are the most straightforward 
method of obtaining sensitive information from unsuspecting 
consumers. The goal of phishers is to obtai n sensitive 
information such as usernames, passwords, and bank account 
numbers.  Cyber security persons a re now looking for 
trustworthy and steady detection techniques for phishing 
websites detection. By extracting and evaluating numerous 
aspects of authent ic and phishing URLs, this project uses 
machine learni ng technology to detect p hishing URLs.  
Phishing web sites are detected  using CNN LSTM & CNN 
Bi-LSTM, Logistic regress ion and XGBoost al gorithms. The 
project's goal is to detect phishing URLs and narrow d own the 
best machine learning algorithm by evaluating each 
algorithm's accuracy  rate, false positive rat e, and false 
negati ve rate .

I. INTRODUCTION + 
 
 
Phishing is an attempt to steal personal information such as 
usernames, passwords,  and credit card numbers (and, 
indirectly, money) by impersonating a trustworthy entity in 
an electronic contact, usually for harmful purposes. Because 
the use of bait in an attempt to catch a victim is comparable, 
this word was coined as a homophone of fi shing. Phishing is 
most c ommonly carried out through email spoofing or instant 
 
 messaging, and it frequently urges people to submit personal 
information on a false website tha t looks and feels very 
identical to the authentic one. Victims are frequently lure d by 
communications appea ring to be from social media sites, 
auction sites, banks, online payment processors, or IT 
administrators.  Links to malware -infected websites may be 
included in phishing emails. Phishing is a type of social 
engineering method that takes advantage of flaws in current 
web security to deceive consumers. Legislation, user 
training, public awareness, and technical security measures  
are all being used to comb at the rising number of reported 
phishing instances. Many websites have develope d 
additional tools for ap plications, such as game maps, 
however they should be clearly labelled as to who built them, 
and users should not use the same passwords across the 
internet.  
 
II.  LITERATURE  SURVEY

Phishing assa ults are on th e rise, resulting in millions of 
dollars in losses each year, particularly in online transactions. 
Toolbars and filters  that display user warnings against 
phishing websites have been used in the past to combat 
phishing attempts. Despite curre nt solutions, there is still an 
inadequacy in online transactions due to a lack of accuracy in 
real-time solutions. This study builds  on our prior work by 
creating an online toolbar that runs in the background of the 
Internet Explorer web brow ser and check s all websites  users 
request in real -time against a set of data. To detect phishing 
websites and notify users from phishing assaults,  the 
proposed approach is a feature -based online toolbar with six 
sets of inputs that includes a voice -generat ing user warn ing 
interface with text directives and color  status.  The new 
toolbar system was thoroughly tested on a wide range of 
websites, includ ing 200 Phishing websites, 200 Suspicious 
Websites, and 200 Legitimate Websites, and it showed the 
best perfor mance (96 per cent) when com pared to prior field 
results. The research presents a novel voice -generating user 
warning interface technique that has not previously been 
studied in the field of phishing website identification.

Web spoofing entices users to connect with bogus websites 
instead of the actual ones. The primary goal of this assault is 
to steal confidential information from users. The attacker 
develops a  'shadow' website that appears to be  identi cal to the 
original site.  This deception allows the attacker to view and 
edit any information the victim provides. This study presents 
a phishin g website detection technique based on inspecting 
web page Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). The proposed  
approa ch checks t he Uniform Res ources Locators (URLs) of 
suspected online pages to distinguish between real and 
fraudulent web pages.  To detect phishi ng web pages, URLs 
are examined based on specific features. The discovered 
assaults are reported to help avoid f uture attac ks. The 
sugges ted solution's performance is assessed using the 
Phistank and Yahoo directory datasets. The acquired 
findings demonstra te that the detection method is deployable 
and capable of detecting various forms of phishing attempts 
while minimizing  false alarms.

A large number of people buy things online and pay for them 
using nume rous websites. Multiple websites frequently 
request sensitive information such as a user's username, 
password, o r credit ca rd information  for authentic ation. 
However, there are certain phishing websites. Which then 
uses that information for nefarious purpo ses. We developed a 
flexible and successful solution based on data mining 
algorithms to detect and anticipate ph ishing webs ites. To 
class ify their auth enticity, we used the Logistic Regression 
algorithm and approaches. In the final phishing detection 
rate, various significant features such as URL, domain 
identity, and security can be used to detect the phishing 
webs ite. Many i nternet users can use this to ol to protect 
themselves from an ocean of phishing sites. This system's 
data mining algorithm gives high er performance. This 
technique also allows users to purchase things online without 
fear of being scammed. Admi s can can als o add phishing  
website URLs o r phoney website URLs to the system, which 
the system can browse and scan. When a user submits it, new 
suspicious URLs can be added.

Phishing sites are imitations of legitimate we bsites crea ted by 
dishone st individuals. These websites resemble the official 
websites of any corporation, such as a bank or an educational 
institution. Phishing's main goal is to steal sensitive 
information from users, such as passwords, usernames, and 
pin numbers. Phishing victi ms may reveal sensitive financial 
information to atta ckers, who may use this information for 
budgetary and criminal pur poses. To identify phishing sites, 
various technical and non -technical ways have been 
presented. Non -technical a pproaches h ave no defense  
against phishing websites' ability to vanish quickly . One of 
the classes of technical approach is data mining, which h as 
demonstrated good results in detecting phishing websites.  
Data mining techniques, as opposed to non -technical  
approaches , can develop classification models that can provide real -time predi ctions on phishing websites. The 
WEKA tool was used to analyze  the C4.5 (J48) data mining 
technique in this work. C4.5 is a data mining benchmark 
technique that can accurately d etect phish ing websites. The 
method J48, which is a WEKA version of the C4.5 al gorithm, 
was trained using a dataset of 750 URLs. The classifier 
developed during J48's training is utilized  to make 
predictions using a testing dataset of 300 URLs. After the 
testing proc ess, the true positive rate, true negative rate, false 
positive rate , false negative rate, success rate, error rate, and 
accuracy are  calculated. C4.5 has an accuracy of 82.6 percent, 
according to the results.

Annually, p hishing costs Internet users a lot of money. It 
refers to attacks that take advantage of weaknesses on the 
user's side. Because there  is no single method to effectively 
mitigate all vulnerabilities in the phish ing problem, 
numerous techniques ar e used. We cover three me thods for 
identifying phishing websites in this research. The first 
strategy examines various elements of the URL; the second 
examines the authenticity of the website by learning where it 
is hoste d and who manages it; and the third  way examin es 
the website 's visual look. For evaluating these diverse aspects 
of URLs and webpages, we use Machine Learning techniques 
and algor ithms.  In this paper, an overview about these 
approaches is presented.

Phishing  websites are one of the internet security issues that 
focus on  human vulnerabilities rather than program  flaws. 
It's the technique o f luring online users in order to get 
sensitive information like usernames and passwords. We 
present an intellig ent techniq ue for detecti ng phishing 
websites in this research. The tech nology works as an addon 
to an internet browser, notifying the user when  it finds a 
phishing website. The system is based on supervised learning, 
which is a type of machine learning.  We chose the  Random 
Forest  approach because of its high categorization 
performance. Our goal is to develop a higher -performing 
classifier by anal ysing the characteristics of phishing 
websites and selecting the best combination of them to train 
the classifie r. As a res ult, we conclu de our work with a 98.8% 
accuracy rate and a tot al of 26 characteristics.  
III. METHODOLOGY  
 
1.Logistic regression  
 
Logistic regression is a regression model where the 
dependent variable (DV) is ca tegorical.  Based on one or more 
independ ent variabl es, logistic r egression is a mathematical 
approach for predicting the probability of a binary response. 
Given certain variables, logi stic regression is used to predict 
a result with two value s, such as 0 or 1, pass or fail, yes or no, 
and so on.  The logist ic regression,  like the rest of the 
regression models, is a prognostic study. It's commonly used 
to visualize  data and highlight the relationship between one

3  
dependent binary and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval, 
or ratio -level independent  variables.  A more compli cated 
cost function is also required. Instead of a linear function, 
this cost function is called the 'Sigmoid function'  or 'logistic 
function.' As demonstrated in Equation, the algorithm's 
hypothesis swings toward the cost function 's limit be tween 0 
and 1.  This Logistic regression covers the case of a binary 
dependent variable --that is, where it can take only two 
values, "" 0"" and ""1"", which represent outcomes such as 
Yes/No ,True/False ,High/Low etc.  
 
                            0<h(x)<1 
 
2.XG boost algorith m 
 
 
XG Boost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting . It's a 
gradient boosted decision tree application that's designed for  
speed and efficiency. Boosting is an ensemble lea rning 
strategy that incorporates additional techniques to cor rect 
faults in previously presented models. Models are added in 
order until no further improvement is possible. To reduce the 
loss when adding ne w models, it employs a gradient descent 
method. Th is approach is used to give fast computing time 
and memory. T he goal of t his approach w as to get the most 
out of the available resources to train the model. The two 
main reasons to work with XG Boost are ex ecution speed and 
model performance.   
 
 
3.CNN -LSTM algorithm  
 
CNN and LSTM integration is a typical notion for 
integrating benefits due t o the accessibility of CNN and 
LSTM. The notion for a novel deep learning scheme was 
proposed in this work by integrati ng CNN and LSTM. Two 
layers of CNN were utilized  to ensure tha t the 
multidimensional data was properly correlat ed and captu red. 
CNN layer  feature series were used as an input for the LSTM 
algorithm. Time dependencies were extracted further in the 
layer LST M. FC1, FC2, and FC3 were all connected in the 
architecture. T he characteristics retrieved from the CNN 
layer a re obtained using FC1 and FC2, and the final 
prediction of results is performed using FC3.  The 
information on the phishing website cannot be adeq uately 
represented by the URL input matrix. In this section, th e 
CNNLSTM URL, a web page code, a text function,  and a 
rapid  grading resul t are integrated to generate 
multidimensional features that explain the overall flow in 
detail. In order to perplex use rs, Phishers usually generate 
phishing URLs by mimicking the UR L of your website. For 
example, a phishing URL a ppears to co ntain a PayPal  
imitator in its subsidiary domain name, which is a mess. 
PayPal rips off PayPal.  
 
 
4.CNN  BI-LSTM algorithm  
 
A Recurren t Neural Network is a type of Bidirectional Long 
Short -Term Memory. It consists of two hidden layers that 
process data in b oth forward an d backward directions, allowing the structure to retain knowledge of past input. It is 
the second layer in our suggeste d architecture, and it is used 
to remember prior transactions that are helpful in predicting 
the output y, whi ch may be exp ressed as foll ows. 
           
yt = g(w y [ht ,ct ]+ b y) 
 
where t = transaction,  w is the weight value assigned to the 
concatenation of  the hidden and current state generated by 
the Bi -LSTM , h and c are the hidden and current state.  
 
 
 
5.DATA SET 
 
Dataset u sed to train th e model is taken from  Kaggle .com . 
This consists of 50 attributes  and more tha n 25 thousand d ata 
entries . Among them 80 percent is considered as training 
data and 20 percent as test data.

are the reason for the best model with hi gh accuracy.  
 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSIO N 
 
In this pap er, the issue of phishing attacks  are considered and 
thus proposed a constructive model  using CNN  LSTM  , 
CNN -Bi-LSTM , Logistic  regres sion and XGBoost  
algorithms  which combined machine learning  mechanism 
and deep neural networks  in data scienc e to detect an d 
classify the  illegitimate URL ’s. Compared with the most 
extensively used LSTM model, the Logistic  regression  and 
XGBoost algorithm model achieve a good accuracy in 
detecting the phishing URL ’s.  Analysis results show the 
adequacy of the mod el, and result s into 9 2% acc uracy.  We 
can further  develop  this application as a website so that it can 
be accessed by anyone .
